                <p class="title-font">‘To Change the World Through Love and Education.’</p>
                <p>The first 4 to 5 years of  your child's life is the most important in so many ways. Speech,  small and large motor functions, social adaptation, mental and  emotional stability - and the list goes on. And as the saying goes,  &ldquo;They don't come with a manual or instructions!&rdquo; So we all do  the best we can as parents, to give our children the very best of  everything that we can. For we would truly give our lives for them if  it meant they would be safe - growing up to be responsible,  successful and happy adults - doing better and achieving more than we  did. Yes, every parent desires the same blessings for their kids. But  what about daycare? We've all heard so many different opinions and  stories, both good and bad. &ldquo;How can anyone possibly take care of  the most precious thing in the world to me - even half as well as I  would?&rdquo; </p>
                <p>Well, in many ways - you are correct. Because no one is you. No  one can replace Mom or Dad, because they only have one Mom and Dad,  and that's you. But want you can do, is filter through all the red  tape and sterile policies and official sounding statements issued by  the bureaucrats - and examine the facts, and then do what your heart  tells you is right. For honestly, no one knows better than you do  what is best for your child - no one! And to help you make the best  decision for you and your baby boy and / or baby girl (or both)  - Lil Hearts Daycare has created our simple yet comprehensive tool  known as &lsquo;SAFE Daycare    '    - an exclusive  LDH methodology and process that allows you, the parent - to make the  best and right decision for your child. SAFE, which stands for the  &lsquo;Selective Analysis Facility Evaluation' - enables the parent to  concisely look at all the critical elements that are most important  to them in the nurturing, protection, and teaching of their child -  and see if Lil Hearts Daycare, or another daycare facility is right  for them. Because we don't want to partner with families that don't  have the same vision, and desire, and values that we do. Lil Hearts  Daycare has painstakingly developed educational programs and unique  teaching methodologies that are far more in-depth, comprehensive, and  robust than most other daycares. And while they all fulfill and  adhere to the Ministry of Education's guidelines, requirements, and  regulations - LHD goes far beyond those baseline measures. For as our  name intentionally declares - we believe that during these most  formative years - that it is the heart of the child that by far needs  to be the most important concern, issue, and focus. Because daycare  is not a PhD program, it's not undergrad, high school, middle  school or even grade school - it's pre Kindergarten! These are  infants, toddlers, and adorable little children - they are just kids!  Do you really want to rob them of their most precious and innocent  years with an endless regime of only scholastic structure? </p>
                <p>At LHD, we have not  forgotten, as some have, what is most important - the heart of the  child. It's not who has the greatest number of kids, the longest  list of books and programs, or the most write-ups in magazines or on  social media - it's about the kids. Their giggle that melts the  hearts of the parents, that innocent smile and expectation in their  eyes that often gives us hope for a better tomorrow, and that hug  they return when we hold them that reminds us what is truly important  in life. They have been created to learn, to grow, to become whatever  they can dream of - and LHD will ensure with everything we do and say  - that is exactly what happens. Because a child's little heart only  has one chance - to make <em>&lsquo;a great start towards their future'</em>. </p>

                <p class="title-font"><font size="5">‘To Teach Children the Joy of Learning.’</font></p>
                <p> Every dream for a better tomorrow has to have a basis of reality, a place to start. It’s one thing to have visions of grandeur and another to actually begin walking towards that end. And regardless of whether that is a hope of a better world, or our child becoming a successful professional, musician, or skilled in trade - if the plan is flawed in the beginning - the end result will be potentially minimized or even in jeopardy. And that is the very sad case for many children today who are placed in pre-school programs and daycares that have at best clouded, if not missed the mark completely. For the most critical part in laying the foundation for success in school and therefore later in life - is joy. </p>
                <p> Think about it, how many things have we as adults consistently continued to engage in activities we didn’t enjoy? The list is probably endless! Ranging from relationships to our work, to eating better, to fitness and to a hobbies. If we were not enJOYing the experience - the effort was either relatively short lived, or we were completely unhappy while trying to endure the misery. Either way, and in more ways than one - it was painful and an emotional withdrawal. In the end, it was a bad memory and something we likely vowed we would never do again. Now, is that really what a parent wants their kids to feel and experience during the most formative years of their lives? To learn to hate the very skill and process that will play such a huge factor in determining the success and happiness of their entire lives? Of course not! So it’s amazing to witness the growing number of daycare programs that more resemble a Masters Degree course in university than a pre-school for little kids. Truly foolish. </p>
                <p> Lil Hearts Daycare does not only not recommend such a ridiculous beginning to your child’s education - but we emphatically warn against it! In fact, for whatever reason, if your child is unable to enroll in a LHD Center, please find one that places the emphasis on ‘Teaching Your Child the Joy of Learning’. For there are few required foundations in the overall development of your child that are as critical as the love and ‘joy of learning’. For the continual hunger for more knowledge will elevate their opportunity for success through the roof. Just as teaching a child to dread the thought of going to school will greatly hinder the possibility of them ever reaching their true potential. Kids are just that - kids. They love to play and have fun, and the more they enJOY learning, the more the will want to learn more and more - for the rest of their lives! </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
              </ul>

                <p class="title-font"><font size="5">‘To Change the World Through Love and Education.’</font></p>
                <p> The society we live in today is not the ‘Leave it to Beaver’ life of days gone by. Kids going merrily off to school. Mom’s at home baking and cleaning all day waiting for Mr. Cleaver to come home - with the whole family then sitting happily around the dinner table with not a care in world. No, today everything moves at the speed of the internet and education is more critical than ever, but so it the safety of children in our increasingly violent and dangerous cities. And unfortunately, there isn’t a magic wand that any of us can wave that will instantly change everything back to the days when we didn’t have to lock our doors at night. </p>
                <p> So what is the answer? Because now, some of our schools even have security guards and metal detectors. The very place where our children’s worst fear used to be accidentally squishing their sandwich, has now become a gauntlet of various threats against their innocence, their self confidence, and their right to a peaceful childhood. And with greater focuses on the institutions of higher learning to recruit the brightest and the best - in order to raise their national college rankings and thereby command even greater tuition - the competitive nature in high schools and even grade schools has begun to rival that of making a AAA hockey team! And so unfortunately, much of the shear joy that kids had at school in decades past - has sadly faded in many ways. And as a result, many more children are not able to cope with the increased pressure placed on them by the curriculum and even some parents - to excel in this scholastic pressure cooker. </p>
                <p> However, we at Lil Hearts Daycare believe that we can help to change this trend, and help safeguard and prepare our little ones to more effectively deal with the changes in the educational system. And as a result, allow them to enjoy and more satisfying and successful educational journey. And it is not by beginning a Navy Seals type training program of discipline and endless hours of homework and exercises - as some believe is the answer. On the contrary, at Lil Hearts Daycare, changing this trend is truly our vision and the purpose for which we live: ‘To Change the World Through Love and Education.’ For we may not have a magic wand, but we can effect change by positively touching the life of one child at a time. That by filling them with the belief and knowledge, that love and kindness and a caring heart, combined with the mental and emotional satisfaction of learning - results in approval and an increased sense of self-worth and confidence - our future is already looking brighter. </p>

                <p class="title-font"><font size="5">‘Parents Who Know the Key to Education is Love.’</font></p>
                <p> It goes with out saying, that as a loving and caring parent, you know that ultimately - your kids are your responsibility. So having to trust someone else to care for your child during the day is a huge decision. And it’s not just about finding someone who is responsible, but finding someone who is as close to ‘You’ as possible. Someone who understands and knows what You would do when your child is happy, sad, pensive, hungry, cold, hot, tired, exuberant - etc., etc., etc. The answer can be summed up with one word, and only one word - each and every time - love. </p>
                <p> Selfless benevolence. Sacrifice. Service. It’s taking no thought of yourself nor what the cost of energy, effort or expense maybe - and immediately doing what is in the best interest of the child. To consistently show them and reinforce that they are cared for, adored, appreciated, wanted, special - that they are loved. Everything from our voice inflection, to our body language, to the look on our faces, to how we take their hand and how we hold them - must scream of safety, acceptance, joy, trust - love. </p>
                <p> And therefore, before working with your child alone, each and every LHD Certified Educator has demonstrated their ability and commitment to love each and every child, according to the following: </p>
                <p align="center"><em> Love endures long and is patient and kind.<br >
                  Love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy,<br >
                  is not boastful or vainglorious, does not display itself haughtily.<br >
                  Love is not conceited or arrogant and is not inflated with pride.<br >
                  Love is not rude nor unmannerly, and does not act unbecomingly. <br >
                  The love He has placed in us does not insist on its own rights,<br >
                  nor its own way -  for it is not self-seeking. <br >
                  Love is not touchy or fretful or resentful,<br >
                  and it takes no account of any evil done to it<br >
                  - nor does it pay attention to a suffered wrong. <br >
                  Love does not rejoice at injustice or unrighteousness,<br >
                  but rejoices when right and truth prevail.<br >
                  Love bears up under everything that comes its way,<br >
                  and is ever ready to believe the best of every person.<br >
                  Love’s hopes are fadeless under all circumstances,<br >
                  endures all things without weakening- is long suffering.<br >
                  Love never fails, it never fades away or becomes obsolete <br >
                  for love has no end!<br >
                  1 Cor 13 </em></p>
                  <p>
                  We at Lil Hearts Daycare have embraced this truth and is the very essence of everything we do. For a child cannot excel and grow mentally or emotionally if they do not know and experience love. And our parents don’t just know this - they demand it - for it’s their precious little child who deserves nothing less. For it is love, that provides the very foundation that allows a child to feel safe and protected, that allows them to trust, that enables them to receive instruction from the talented educator - that results in your child learning. And all those wonderful events happen, because <em>‘the key to education is love!’</em> </p>

                It’s one thing for a company to declare it’s goals and objectives, but it’s another thing completely for them to actually deliver. And it’s not to say that the a company’s ownership lacks ‘intention’ or ‘desire’ - the problem lies in the fact the key components are not the right fit. For as is the case with most organizations and most professions,  the 20 / 80 rule is usually present. That is - only 20% of the accountants, lawyers, doctors, teachers, engineers, etc. - really love what they do and are really good at what they do. While the other 80% would prefer to be doing something else, and most often ‘should’ be doing something else. And, in an industry such as daycare, in which the entry point is easily accessible, this rule is very prevalent - but often for other reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                Daycare tends to have individuals that seem to migrate to one focus or the other. That is, the emphasis being on teaching and discipline, like Montessori; or mostly fun and play, like many of the home-based daycares. And as a separate element, there is nothing wrong with any of the four - in fact, they are all required components of effective education. The problem occurs when the emphasis is weighted to one side or the other, as is usually the case in the above examples. For most home-based daycares are not run by university degreed and Provincially certified teachers with early childhood education. And teachers who are attracted to very rigid guidelines tend to be those who believe structure and disciplined study are the most important components - even for a young child. Here at Lil Heart’s Daycare - we are not only daycare professionals, educators, and child care experts - we are an organization comprised of loving parents and professionals, whose passion is to pour our hearts and souls into the precious little children entrusted to us. And therefore, neither of the two extremes above are acceptable, permitted, or practiced. For as our Company Identity statement declares, both a ‘Playful Heart’ and a ‘Teaching Mind’ is a pre-requisite for any professional to become a LHD Certified Educator. Why? Because without those character traits, the ability to impart the ‘joy of learning’ to child is impossible. And if that is the case, then full potential of child’s ability to learn throughout their lives has been compromised. But as we identified above, it’s one thing to make a declaration, but it’s another to actually deliver.
                </p>
                <p>
                Therefore, Lil Hearts Daycare, having utilized various human resource evaluation tools in the past, that individually all had some deficiencies - has, with the assistance of a recruiting and training expert, developed the LHD ‘Hiring with EASE Process  ’. This Educator Assessment, Selection & Evaluation process ensures that the various character traits of those with ‘Playful Hearts’ as well as both the qualifications and know-how of a ‘teaching mind’ are all resident in every LHD Certified Educator. As a result, our parents are guaranteed that their children will be loved, taught the joy of learning, and - get ‘the great start to the future’ that every child deserves.

                A job is something someone does to make money. A profession is something for which someone has received training. But a vocation is …
                </p>
                <p>
                Def: -<em> A life to which a person is specially drawn, a strong impulse or inclination for which they are suited, trained and / or qualified to fulfill and follow; a particular activity and / or career such as divine call to God's service.</em> </p>
                <p>
                And that is exactly how each and every LHD Certified Educator (CE) can be described, as one who has been ‘called’ - to love and protect and teach children. And, with a purpose of life so deeply engrained in their hearts, it is simply an expression of what has already been placed within them - to care for your child as they would their own. And this is the very reason why Lil Hearts Daycare can make the promises we do, and guarantee an amazing experience for your child everyday. It begins with the LHD EASE Hiring Process, that ensures each CE has been vetted for the both the personal qualities and character traits, as well as the ability to effectively apply their secondary and early childhood education. And then, this is consistently shown to each child by every CE working within the LHD Always CARE company mandate - our proprietary methodology by which all of our Infant, Toddler, and Pre-School programs are delivered. This is our mindset, and this is what every CE lives and breathes every minute of every hour when your child is in our CARE. And allows us to fulfill what we love doing most - and our guarantee to you - that your child will be cared for, as if they are our own.

                <p>
                During our parent interviews Always CARE    is explained in step-by-step detail, as are all the specifics of the various LHD programs, activities, and unique methodologies that make Lil Hearts Daycare the choice of parents who want the very best for their children. And just as importantly, we have the parents explain to us their personal educational goals and desires for their child, using the SAFE Daycare selection process. So with all parties on exactly the same page, there are no surprises, only known and expected results - that their child will feel like they are at home, feeling safe and having fun just as if Mom and Dad were there. And isn’t that just what every caring and loving parent deserves? We think so.
