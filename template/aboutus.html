        <p> <strong>Lil Hearts Daycare</strong> has very unique and interesting beginning, unlike most daycares you have likely ever known. And as a result, the ‘feeling’ and the ‘programs’ that are offered by <strong>LHD</strong> are as unique as it’s <strong>Founder &amp; President, Monina Navarrete</strong>. </p>
        <p> Ms. Navarrete grew up in the Philippines, and from a very young age was always fascinated with and drawn to the profession of teaching. As her parents said, as she often pretended to teach her dolls in the make believe class room - “It was truly in her blood.” And so the journey continued, as she successfully proceeded through high-school and then in university, excelling in the maths and sciences, with her first degree being a <strong>Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering.</strong> But her heart’s desire was not to create the next super glue, but to teach the subjects she loved best to others. And soon, she was behind a desk doing exactly that - with high-school students. For several years she<strong> taught various math and science programs,</strong> but like so many of us when we are young, the ‘rose coloured’ glasses through which we see the world and it’s opportunities - isn’t exactly as we had envisioned. And that was indeed the case for Monina, for the loud and often intimidating students (for she is just over 5 feet tall) was not the environment that her dolls, whom she taught so diligently as child, would have felt comfortable in - and neither did she. </p>
        <p> However, her skills as a teacher and proficiency as an administrator was noticed by the Superintendent, and as a result Ms. Navarrete was <strong>offered a job as a Principal</strong> at a nearby school. And although she enjoyed the challenge, things did not really improve. For although she was largely dealing with the faculty, her passion - teaching - had now been completely removed for her life. There needed to be a change. And there was. She was aware of an opening to<strong> teach math and science in grades 3 and 4,</strong> and she jumped at, even though it was drop in pay, she longed to back in the classroom - and this time with students who were smaller than she was! The experience was wonderful, but as fate would have it, her teaching prowess and uncanny way with kids who just seemed to truly love her - resulted in her being recommended, unbenounced to her - and then requested by the<strong> Royal Families of Oman</strong> to teach their children. With much prayer and deliberation, she finally decided to accept the offer. It was the best decision of her life. And not because of the lavish surroundings nor the special treatment - but because <strong>she had finally found her ‘calling’</strong> - what she was truly created to be and do. For part of her responsibilities now, did not just include grade school and high school, as she was accustomed to - but to also<strong> teach and take care of the little children - infants, toddlers, and pre-schoolers.</strong> She was in heaven! </p>
        <p> So now, after 28 years of teaching, a Masters in Education,<strong> certified in Early Childcare, and an Ontario College Teachers Licence </strong>- Monina Navarrete has begun yet another chapter in her life. For now, after 5 years working in numerous daycares, 3 in other facilities - ranging from small spaces to large 150 plus child centers with multiple branches, experience with both privately funded and subsidized operations - <strong>she has seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of the full gamete of what daycares have to offer.</strong> And that is what lead to the opening of the first Lil Hearts Daycare Center - her desire to provide the most loving environment and most effective pre-school education found anywhere in Canada. And based on the accolades of all her<strong> ‘LHD Families’</strong> as she calls them, it seems that she is well on her way to teaching many more children the joy of learning, and … </p>
