					<font size="5"><i>‘Educators with Playful Hearts and Teaching Minds.’</i></font></p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Daycare tends to have individuals that seem to migrate to one focus or the other.</strong> That is, the emphasis being on teaching and discipline, like Montessori; or mostly fun and play, like many of the home-based daycares. And as a separate element, there is nothing wrong with any of the four - <strong>in fact, they are all required components of effective education.</strong> The problem occurs when the emphasis is weighted to one side or the other, as is usually the case in the above examples. For most home-based daycares are not run by university degreed and Provincially certified teachers with early childhood education. And teachers who are attracted to very rigid guidelines tend to be those who believe structure and disciplined study are the most important components - even for a young child. </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Here at Lil Heart’s Daycare</strong> - we are not only daycare professionals, educators, and child care experts - we are an organization comprised of loving parents and professionals, whose passion is to pour our hearts and souls into the precious little children entrusted to us <strong>as our program outline below will show...</strong></p>

					<p>Children between the ages of 6  to 18 months participate in a supportive and personalized infant program. Trying to understand them more when they tell something by looking, reaching, babbling, smiling, or crying. At this stage LHD provides a more enhanced program that helps the infant’s needs. There are plenty of group activities and an outdoor program twice a day for at least an hour, as the weather permits. Quiet sleep room provides a porta crib to meet each child’s sleeping needs.</p>

					<p>Children between the ages of 18 months  to 30 months (2.5 years) within our toddler program begins the early stages of the socialization process. This exciting stage focuses on fine and gross motor skills, language development, and sensory development with plenty of directed play. One of those are collecting rocks, seeds, leaves, twigs, and flowers. Feel the objects while we look at them and talk about the different weights, colours, shapes and sizes. The outdoor program is important at LHD and we have a minimum of two hours of outdoor learning and play each day, depends on the weather. The nap time is two hours every day and we potty train to encourage them to be more at their own.

Skills’ development, including writing one’s name, identifying the letter of the alphabet through matching, counting and writing numbers, building, identifying more colours and shapes, creative development and lots of socialization under a play-based learning program which is one of the important part of each preschool day activity. There is a 2 hour nap period each day and two hours of outdoor play. The additional programming at this stage includes arts,  music and sports learning.</p>
